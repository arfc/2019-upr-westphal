	abstract = {In order to enhance the throughput of a pyroprocessing in which electrochemical processes are
mostly engaged, the design of a continuous concept is required. The graphite cathode in the electrorefiner
enables the uranium deposit on the cathodes to be stripped off spontaneously, resulting in a continuous
reaction. The collected uranium deposits at the bottom of the inner cone of the reactor are transferred by a
conveyer. The residuals in the anode basket after the uranium is depleted are noble metals. These are also
collected at the bottom of the outer shell of the reactor, and conveyed from the reactor for a further
treatment. This work addresses the design of the electrorefiner for a continuous operation. The behavior
of particles such as uranium dendrites or noble metals was analyzed to achieve the proper operating
conditions. The operating conditions for the cathode processor in which molten salt is distilled were also
investigated.},
